# Overview for linear_regression_quiz
This is the code for a linear regression test for Udacity's Nanodegree Foundation in Deep Learning. In this quiz, we will learn how to make a prediction using machine learning.

## Explanation
The goal is to predict a person's life expectancy based on their BMI at birth. The model we'll be using is called [Linear Regression](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/what-is-linear-regression/). The dataset we're using to train our model is a list of country, BMI and Life expectancy of 163 people. We'll fit our line to the data using the scikit learn machine learning library. Then we'll use scikit's predict function to well... predict, the life expectancy of a person who's BMI is 21.07931.

##Dependencies

* pandas
* scikit-learn


##Credits

The datasource is gapminder, while the code is based on what I've learned during Siraj Raval's Nanodegree Course on Udacity.
